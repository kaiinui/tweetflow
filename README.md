- ! 3 minutes implementation. Refactoring required.
- Known Issues:
  1. dirty implementation
  2. it waits unnecessary 6 seconds when it shows (due to thinkless use of setInterval)
  3. performance issue on iPhone 4S Chrome (just putting too much element)

- Future Work
  1. New comment interface
  2. Facebook Public feed support. (is it able to fetch Like! on time?)
  3. Refactoring
